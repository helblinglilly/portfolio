My passion project, which is now on its third iteration using Svelte. While plenty of front-ends to the world of Pok√©mon already exist, none of them solve my needs quite right. On mobile, the site needs to feel light-weight and easily digestable. Additional features of the site should seek to be non-intrusive.

At its core, it is just a PokeAPI frontend. But a number of microservices have sprawled from it. Lots of sites also let their data become out of date which is incredibly infuriating - and one day that will be me, so an auto-update functionality was also quite important.

Product and project aside, it's also been a massive learning opportunity to apply new tech to a real product, such as:

- Auto-ingesting new data without need for manual input
    - Using AWS Lambda and SQS
    - Auto-deploying changes to a Github Repo
- Using Pocketbase as a simple backend
    - Handling OAuth
    - Deploying to AWS with proper backup strategies
    - Building a re-usable Pocketbase Terraform module
- Using Cloudflare
    - Pages projects to host this site
    - R2 to host social media preview images
    - Workers as microservices
- Observability
    - Error reporting with Sentry
    - Log ingest with Axiom
    - Migrate the above to New Relic
