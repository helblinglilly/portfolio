This project, in its original form, existed since 2021 and has undergone several, major iterations. There's so much to talk about, I think it's best to just link out to the individual blog posts:

[It originally lived on my Raspberry Pi](/blog/2022-homeserver)

[Then I moved it to Vercel](blog/2023-pokewiki)

[Before starting from scratch on Cloudflare workers](/blog/2023-cloudflare)

Most recently, after [a number of platform improvements](/blog/2026-pokecompanion-rewrite) I can honestly say I'm proud of it, and the journey it took.

Svelte Kit deployed to Cloudflare, ExpressJS API hosted on a VPS with Pocketbase acting as a database.
