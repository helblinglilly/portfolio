Quick POC using <a href="https://ffmpegwasm.netlify.app/">ffmpeg WASM</a> to compare its performance against my "toMP4" <a href="https://github.com/helblinglilly/mac-quick-actions">macOS quick action</a>.

Should not seriously be used as its performance is terrible, but it runs entirely client-side.
