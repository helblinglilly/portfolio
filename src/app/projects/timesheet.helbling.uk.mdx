I love my work, I love my family, and I love getting sucked into complex problems. To make sure I maintain a healthy work-life balance, I like to track my hours. Ve that for time that I spend at work, on specific projects, or boring things like chores.

Making a website made sense - I can tie data to auth, share records with my work account, and access this from any device should I forget to sign off.

This project is incredibly boring, but I use it every day. I maintain this in the background and I'm slowly product-ising it so that it could become a proper SaaS that others might feasibly want to use. But for now, it does what I need it to do and I built it. That makes me happy.

NextJS App router project, hosted on a VPS with Pocketbase.
