I like to listen to TTS reddit videos before going to bed.

My subscriptions tab gets flooded in the evenings, so Youtube does not have a nice way to just surface these videos to me. Despite "reddit" being a daily search for me, Youtube will try recommend other content to me, causing frustration.

To avoid this daily hide-and-seek before going to sleep, I've put this page together to just show the latest videos uploaded by a handful of channels and deeplink into the Youtube app.

Search API calls to youtube are quite expensive, so I cache the API responses quite aggressively.
