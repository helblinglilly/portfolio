Not being able to quickly and easily share links between my laptop and my phone was really annoying.

There are a ton of other tools out there that are better and more sophisticated. Alas, unless I can easily find those (such as by having a memorable URL), they might as well not exist.

Appending any URL to the domain will generate a scannable QR code to that page.
