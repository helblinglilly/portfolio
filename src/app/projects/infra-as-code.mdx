While I've previously been able to rely on the free tiers of different SaaS Platforms, I wanted to own the infrastructure for <a href="#pokecompanion">Pok√©companion</a> and deal with all of its associated challenges along the way.

Moving all of my existing setup into Terraform (later ditched for OpenTofu) was a fair bit of effort and I didn't want to over-engineer a proper secret storing mechanism so it's a shame I can't share my setup.
However, I wanted to create a module for a Pocketbase instance on EC2 which I did <a href="https://github.com/helblinglilly/aws-pocketbase">rewrite and publish in the open</a>.

This has been by far the best investment of my time. I later moved my <a href="#homeserver">homelab</a> Ansible playbooks into this repo as well after my Raspberry Pi SD Cards got corrupted, saving me hours in later reconstructing my setup.

The last time I updated this section, this has now grown to managing 12 Projects via a private Github repo.
