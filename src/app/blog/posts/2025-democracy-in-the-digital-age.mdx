# Values

Remember when we were children, and we were thought to show kindness and compassion to each other? Every child's individuality is encouraged. We learn that it's okay to be different as, later in life, we will instincitvely fear the unknown.

> "Never be cruel and never be cowardly. And if you ever are, always make amends"<br />
<i>Peter Capaldi as the 12th Doctor, S9E12</i>

I like to remind myself of this every so often as it's easy to get driven by anger.

Compassion brings us together, it's how we bond with another. It unites us. A world without compassion is a world without community. It's a skill that is being suppressed, and later on I'll offer my opinion as to why that might be. We need to remind ourselves that we're all just people, and that we're at our best when we're supporting each other.

I struggle to describe the current political climate as anything other than cruel. Of course, depending on who you are, it's been this way for quite some time. Somehow, showing compassion and letting people live their lives has become political. While this is not a recent development, it has only started to affect me directly in recent years.

Progress is never linear and things will be better again - given time. Our task now is to make sure this will be sooner rather than later. In the meantime, let's not make things too difficult for ourselves, eh?

# A tangent about democracy in the modern age

I'd like start with another quote from Peter Capaldi's era in Doctor Who.

> Doctor: "You could take this planet in a heartbeat. Why do you need consent?"<br />
  Monk: "We must be wanted. We must be loved. To rule through fear is inefficient"<br />
  <i>Doctor Who, S10E07</i>

In the next episode we learn that the monks, after taking over the world, have been rewriting history. Making it seem as though they have been helping humanity throughout history when in reality it has only been but months. The history books are written by the victors.

You might wonder how this applies, when there is no history to be written about yet. It's about controlling the narritive.

Observing discussions about any topic will make you question where you stand. You listen to both sides of the argument and consider which one you're more aligned with.
Now imagine - the conversation you're following is a collection of LLM (e.g. ChatGPT) powered Twitter bots talking to each other.

Which side did you pick? How did you emotionally respond to different arguments, and how did that shape your opinion of the other side? The impact this can have on us is significant yet often subconscious.

I think the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Internet_theory">dead internet theory</a> is more plausible than ever. Most people don't post online, they listen to what other people have to say.
I'd also argue that the way we hold discussions on the internet has become more polarising. Nobody is going to read through a long, researched, well articulated message and engage with it. Is it more entertaining to say "After considering all your points I agree with some, but not all" or "lol what, you are fundamentally wrong". Ragebait is more accessible, engages many more people and forms a clear, dividing line between two sides.

## We can be easily manipulated

Algorithms, controlled by a handful of people, decide what is worthy of people's attention and what is not. Meanwhile, LLMs are only becoming cheaper and more powerful to use at scale to give the impression of public sentiment. If you control both, you shape public opinion.

Strong emotional responses engage us, sometimes leading us to argue with strangers and bots. This didn't matter as much a couple of years ago. Platform cared about how much time actual humans spent on them so they could sell ads at a higher price. Twitter always struggled to break even, but it seems that they didn't care. They were in charge of a powerful platform and just wanted to keep it going, pulling the marionette strings in more or less subtle ways.

After Elon Musk took over, I believe he made public opinion his main goal but needed to raise more money to offset the loss in platform ad-worth this would create. People were always going to leave the platform in response to change, but this felt different. To me, it felt like the far-right echo chambers were just getting louder so I decided to leave.

## Engagement

Those that are still on X will be exposed more fake-arguments, ragebait, and radicalising discourse than before. Other major platforms are not any better, but X seems happy to do this in broad daylight. Engagement will only speed this up.

Every centralised platform will suffer from this - not one entity should be allowed to influence such a big cohort of people. We used to fear newspapers for this very reason, then helped build the digital empires of today.

I keep thinking about <a href="https://www.tomscott.com/">Tom Scott</a>'s video <a href="https://youtu.be/LkH2r-sNjQs">"Why Electronic Voting Is Still A Bad Idea"</a>. Specifically around the introduction. Trust cannot be placed in a single person as they could be bribed or incompetent and that attacks on digital voting systems scale easily. When this video was published the fear was that people seeking to get into power would rig the results. With today's technology, I'd argue, you don't need to rig an election result if you can easily sway people's opinion via social media.

"To rule through fear is inefficient. We must be loved".

I don't believe any populists like Donald Trump, Nigel Ferage or Alice Weidel genuinely believe what they say. They are strategically manipulating the masses, getting them to love them by creating fake scenarios triggering strong emotional responses where, after very little thought, either side of the argument will have formed an immediate opinion about them as a leader.

# Conclusion

Populism is designed to divide the people.

Populism feeds on polarisation, therefore, nuance kills populism.

If I could suggest some take-aways for next time that you're browsing social media:

- Don't believe everything you read
- Check your emotional responses
- Check the integrity and motivation of those causing these responses
