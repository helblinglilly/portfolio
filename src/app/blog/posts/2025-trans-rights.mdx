## Prefix

Is selfish to post an opinion about human values in reaction to news that directly targets a demographic which I'm part of? Maybe - but when people are willing to listen, say something that matters.

This is based on my personal opinions and experiences. Citation needed.

# Values

Remember when we were children, and we were thought to show kindness and compassion to each other? Every child's individuality is encouraged. We learn that it's okay to be different as, later in life, we will instincitvely fear the unknown.

> "Never be cruel and never be cowardly. And if you ever are, always make amends"<br />
<i>Peter Capaldi as the 12th Doctor, S9E12</i>

I like to remind myself of this every so often, because it's easy to get fueled by anger.

Compassion brings us together, it's how we bond with another. It unites us. A world without compassion is a world without community. It's a skill that is being suppressed, and later on I'll offer my opinion as to why that might be. We need to remind ourselves that we're all just people, and that we're at our best when we're supporting each other.

I struggle to describe the current political climate as anything other than cruel. Of course, depending on who you are, it's been this way for quite some time. Somehow, showing compassion and letting people live their lives has become political. While this is not a recent development, it has only started to affect me directly in recent years.

Progress is never linear, but let's not try to go back too far, eh?

## Divide and conquer

This recent ruling is not _actually_ about "protecting" anybody. This is about making headlines, creating polarising debates and deplatforming those who disagree.

Queerphobes will be rubbing their hands together like flies, seeing the LGBTQ+ community infight, as to whether it includes the "T" or not. What groups like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGB_Alliance" target="_blank">LGB-Allience</a> fail to realise is that their part of the community will be next, until there is no acronym left and they are either in prisons or 6ft under.

Whether people are left handed, women, communists, gay, follow a different religion, or were born on the other side of an imaginary line on the ground, those in power will always seek to divide the people and create an "us and them". Creating a narritive that "we" need to be protected and that "they" are not welcome here. Where's the humanity in that?

What would working people, humanity, be able to achieve if we were united. Would we allow ourselves to be controlled by a single person? I doubt it.

They are scared that if we unite, we will overthrow them. So they keep us distracted and fighting each other until we are a homogenous people with no difference in personality, thought, or opinion that are easily controlled for <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-truth-social-djt-tesla-musk-tariffs-pause-fccfa6b06c8f1ec0cd7844641ca52669">personal gain.</a>


## On the Supreme Courts decision

I am not going to entertain a dicussion about this. As a trans woman, my stance is hopefully obvious.

The objective of this case was always to seek clarification in law and to make a simple decision. Creating an easy to understand system, ignoring edge cases. Programmers might be able to relate. Which approach would you find easier to work with?


<Code
languageName="ts"
code ={`interface Gender {
    // obviously this would be male-centric
    isMale: true | false
}`}
/>


or like this:

<Code
languageName="ts"
code ={`interface GenderIdentity {
    assignedGenderAtBirth: 'female' | 'male';
    anatomyAtBirth: 'venus' | 'mars'  | 'other';
    currentAnatomy: 'venus' | 'mars' | 'other';
    legalSex: 'female' | 'male'  | 'non-binary';
    perceivedIdentityBySociety: 'female' | 'male' | 'people_get_confused';
    identity: string;
    pronouns: Array<{
        direct: string;
        indirect: string;
    }>
}`}
/>


_If there are issues with the above, please get in touch - I don't mean to offend any groups but to illustrate a point._

This might seem overly comprehensive, but depending on the context, different parts might be relevant. A trans man being brought in for a prostate exam might not be appropriate. Identity will not matter when a person's remains are rediscovered in a couple of millenia. Some people might consider anatomy for dating, some might not.

What is clear, is that in regards to the Equalities Act 2010, identity matters as that's how people get discriminated against.

---

The current outcome is not enforceable in everyday life, only in courts. How would that possibly be protecting cis-women in single-sex spaces? A predetor will not stop at the risk of a law suit or time in prison. Similarly to how a predetor won't be stopped by a sign on a toilet door. -- how this is therefore disproportionally negatively affecting trans people.



If the decision would have been anything else, it would have quickly come under public scrutiny. The usual "woke", "common sense" arguments. Alas, since they are pleased with the outcome and the result is outragous, there is no discussion about this.

---


Less attention is paid to the fact that this decision was unanimous. A fact that gives me confidence that trans rights will likely decline over the coming years, rather than improve.

# A tangent about democracy in the modern age

I'd like start with another quote from Peter Capaldi's era in Doctor Who.

> Doctor: "You could take this planet in a heartbeat. Why do you need consent?"<br />
  Monk: "We must be wanted. We must be loved. To rule through fear is inefficient"<br />
  <i>Doctor Who, S10E07</i>

In the next episode we learn that the monks, after taking over the world, have been rewriting history. Making it seem as though they have been helping humanity throughout all of history when in reality it has only been but months. The history books are written by the victors.

You might wonder how this applies, when there is no history to be written about yet - control the narritive.

Observing discussions about any topic will make you question where you stand. You listen to both sides of the argument and consider which one you're more aligned with.
Now imagine - the conversation you're following is a collection of LLM (e.g. ChatGPT) powered Twitter bots talking to each other.

What side did you pick? How did you emotionally respond to different arguments, and how did that shape your opinion of the other side? The impact this can have on us is significant yet often subconscious.

I think the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Internet_theory">dead internet theory</a> is more plausible than ever. Most people don't post online, they listen to what other people have to say.
I'd also argue that the way we hold discussions on the internet has become more polarised. Nobody is going to read through a long, researched, well articulated message and engage with it. Ragebait truely wins people's attention and forms a clear, dividing line between two sides.

## We can be easily manipulated

Algorithms, controlled by a handful of people, decide what gets aggregated and what doesn't. LLMs are only becoming cheaper and more accessible to use at scale. If you control both, you shape public opinion.

Strong emotional responses engage us, sometimes even leading us to argue with strangers/bots. That's nice and all, but the platform only cares about how much time actual humans spend on it, as that allows them to sell more ads. Twitter always struggled to break even, but it seems that they didn't care much. They were in charge of a powerful platform and just wanted to keep it going, pulling the marionette strings in more or less subtle ways.

After Elon Musk took over, he decided to make it an echo chamber of his own opinions. People were always going to leave the platform in response to change, but this felt different. To me, Twitter just became... boring. Often, it wasn't faciliating conversations between people anymore, it just became a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/1i7w9j/comment/cb1wxe6">circlejerk</a> (SFW, I promise!).

That being said, there are still millions of people active on X, able to be influenced. If you're one of them, do consider leaving.

## It's about control

Millions of people, witnessing the normalisation of an increasingly radical, inhumane discourse. It might not directly translate into expressing those opinions IRL, but it will influence their views and how they vote at the ballot box.

Twitter/X is just an example where _a_ collapse has been reported on by the media. Every centralised platform will suffer from this - not one entity should be allowed to influence such a big cohort of people. We used to fear newspapers for this very reason, then helped build the digital empires of today.

I keep thinking about <a href="https://www.tomscott.com/">Tom Scott</a>'s video <a href="https://youtu.be/LkH2r-sNjQs">"Why Electronic Voting Is Still A Bad Idea"</a>. Specifically around the introduction. Trust cannot be placed in a single person as they could be bribed or incompetent and that attacks on digital voting systems scale easily. When this video was published the fear was that people seeking to get into power would rig the results. With today's technology, I'd argue, you don't need to rig an election result if you can easily sway people's opinion via social media.

"To rule through fear is inefficient. We must be loved".

I don't believe any populists like Donald Trump, Nigel Ferage or Alice Weidel genuinely believe what they say. They are strategically manipulating the masses, getting them to love them by creating fake scenarios triggering strong emotional responses where, after very little thought, either side of the argument will have formed an immediate opinion about them as a leader.

# Conclusion

If I could suggest some take-aways for next time that you're browsing social media:

- Don't believe everything you read
- Check your emotional responses
- Check the integrity and motivation of those causing these responses
