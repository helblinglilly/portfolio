## Prefix

Is selfish to post an opinion about human values in reaction to news that directly targets a demographic which I'm part of? Maybe - but when people are willing to listen, say something that matters.

This is based on my personal opinions and experiences. Citation needed.

# Values

Remember when we were children, and we were thought to show kindness and compassion to each other? Every child's individuality is encouraged. We learn that it's okay to be different as, later in life, we will instincitvely fear the unknown.

> "Never be cruel and never be cowardly. And if you ever are, always make amends"<br />
<i>Peter Capaldi as the 12th Doctor, S9E12</i>

I like to remind myself of this every so often, because it's easy to become anger driven.

Compassion brings us together, it's how we bond with another. It unites us. A world without compassion is a world without community. It's a skill that is being suppressed, and later on I'll offer my opinion as to why that might be. We need to remind ourselves that we're all just people, and that we're at our best when we're supporting each other.

I struggle to describe the current political climate as anything other than cruel. Of course, depending on who you are, it's been this way for quite some time. Somehow, showing compassion and letting people live their lives has become political. While this is not a recent development, it has only started to affect me directly in recent years.

Progress is never linear and things will be better again - given time. Our task now is to make sure this will be sooner rather than later. In the meantime, let's not make things too difficult for ourselves, eh?

## Divide and conquer

This recent ruling is not _actually_ about "protecting" anybody. This is about making headlines, creating polarising debates and deplatforming those who disagree.

Queerphobes will be rubbing their hands together like flies, seeing the LGBTQ+ community infight, as to whether it includes the "T" or not. What groups like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGB_Alliance" target="_blank">LGB-Allience</a> fail to realise is that their part of the community will be next, until there is no acronym left and they are either in prisons or 6ft under.

Whether people are left handed, women, communists, gay, follow a different religion, or were born on the other side of an imaginary line on the ground, those in power will always seek to divide the people and create an "us and them". Creating a narritive that "we" need to be protected and that "they" are not welcome here. Where's the humanity in that? Where does this lead to? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_They_Came">History is full of examples</a>.

What would the working people, humanity, be able to achieve if we united? Power would be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens%27_assembly">distributed</a> and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-truth-social-djt-tesla-musk-tariffs-pause-fccfa6b06c8f1ec0cd7844641ca52669">less easily abused</a>.


In the immediate term, we can fight against this by calling out fabricated issues for what they are instead of engaging and normalising them. In the long term, we need to stand up for each other, show empathy, and remember that we're all just humans. It's never too late to learn, admit past mistakes, and try to be a better person tomorrow, than we were today.


## On the Supreme Courts decision

I am not going to entertain a dicussion about this. It is populism at its finest.

Gender is nuanced, complex, and individual - thereby not easily compatible with the law. As the objective was to clarify the law, creating a flow-chart with as few steps as possible, the result is sadly not surprising.

Much like software engineers, they were effectively asked to either take on a big project with a high maintenance burden, or reduce scope and create something that works 80% of the time and pretend the other 20% don't exist. What kind of code / law, would you find easier to follow as a reader?

<Code
languageName="ts"
code ={`interface Gender {
    // obviously this would be male-centric
    isMale: true | false
}`}
/>


or like this:

<Code
languageName="ts"
code ={`interface GenderIdentity {
    assignedGenderAtBirth: 'female' | 'male';
    anatomyAtBirth: 'venus' | 'mars'  | 'other';
    currentAnatomy: 'venus' | 'mars' | 'other';
    legalSex: 'female' | 'male'  | 'non-binary';
    perceivedIdentityBySociety: 'female' | 'male' | 'people_get_confused';
    identity: string;
    pronouns: Array<{
        direct: string;
        indirect: string;
    }>
}`}
/>


_If there are issues with the above, please get in touch - I don't mean to offend any groups but to illustrate a point._

You might argue that the second block is overly complicated and not applicable to everyday life. However, depending on the context, different parts might be relevant. A trans man being brought in for a prostate exam might not be appropriate. Identity will not matter when a person's remains are rediscovered in a couple of millenia. Some people might consider anatomy for dating, some might not.

What is clear, is that in regards to the Equalities Act 2010, identity matters as that's how people get discriminated against.

The outcome is not enforceable in everyday life, only in the courts. How could this possibly be protecting cis women in single-sex spaces? A predetor will not stop at the risk of a law suit or time in prison, same as they won't be stopped by a sign on a toilet door. Who will be stopped by this? The trans woman who's just trying to go about her business. She will fear that it will take just on TERF to clock her, and her life could be turned upside down.

Of course, trans men and the implications get forgotten about. By this logic, women _do_ feel safe with men in their bathrooms but only if they don't want to be there. This would also be a walk in the park for any predetors. Why bother "putting a dress and lipstick on" when he could just waltz in there claim he's trans.

No matter which perspective you consider, this ruling does not make practical sense. It is however, in the eyes of some people, the intuitive answer. It's the answer which aligns with their close-minded world view which dare not be challenged by anyone.

# A tangent about democracy in the modern age

I'd like start with another quote from Peter Capaldi's era in Doctor Who.

> Doctor: "You could take this planet in a heartbeat. Why do you need consent?"<br />
  Monk: "We must be wanted. We must be loved. To rule through fear is inefficient"<br />
  <i>Doctor Who, S10E07</i>

In the next episode we learn that the monks, after taking over the world, have been rewriting history. Making it seem as though they have been helping humanity throughout all of history when in reality it has only been but months. The history books are written by the victors.

You might wonder how this applies, when there is no history to be written about yet - control the narritive.

Observing discussions about any topic will make you question where you stand. You listen to both sides of the argument and consider which one you're more aligned with.
Now imagine - the conversation you're following is a collection of LLM (e.g. ChatGPT) powered Twitter bots talking to each other.

What side did you pick? How did you emotionally respond to different arguments, and how did that shape your opinion of the other side? The impact this can have on us is significant yet often subconscious.

I think the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Internet_theory">dead internet theory</a> is more plausible than ever. Most people don't post online, they listen to what other people have to say.
I'd also argue that the way we hold discussions on the internet has become more polarised. Nobody is going to read through a long, researched, well articulated message and engage with it. Ragebait truely wins people's attention and forms a clear, dividing line between two sides.

## We can be easily manipulated

Algorithms, controlled by a handful of people, decide what gets aggregated and what doesn't. LLMs are only becoming cheaper and more accessible to use at scale. If you control both, you shape public opinion.

Strong emotional responses engage us, sometimes even leading us to argue with strangers/bots. That's nice and all, but the platform only cares about how much time actual humans spend on it, as that allows them to sell more ads. Twitter always struggled to break even, but it seems that they didn't care much. They were in charge of a powerful platform and just wanted to keep it going, pulling the marionette strings in more or less subtle ways.

After Elon Musk took over, he decided to make it an echo chamber of his own opinions. People were always going to leave the platform in response to change, but this felt different. To me, Twitter just became... boring. Often, it wasn't faciliating conversations between people anymore, it just became a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/1i7w9j/comment/cb1wxe6">circlejerk</a> (SFW, I promise!).

That being said, there are still millions of people active on X, able to be influenced. If you're one of them, do consider leaving.

## It's about control

Millions of people, witnessing the normalisation of an increasingly radical, inhumane discourse. It might not directly translate into expressing those opinions IRL, but it will influence their views and how they vote at the ballot box.

Twitter/X is just an example where _a_ collapse has been reported on by the media. Every centralised platform will suffer from this - not one entity should be allowed to influence such a big cohort of people. We used to fear newspapers for this very reason, then helped build the digital empires of today.

I keep thinking about <a href="https://www.tomscott.com/">Tom Scott</a>'s video <a href="https://youtu.be/LkH2r-sNjQs">"Why Electronic Voting Is Still A Bad Idea"</a>. Specifically around the introduction. Trust cannot be placed in a single person as they could be bribed or incompetent and that attacks on digital voting systems scale easily. When this video was published the fear was that people seeking to get into power would rig the results. With today's technology, I'd argue, you don't need to rig an election result if you can easily sway people's opinion via social media.

"To rule through fear is inefficient. We must be loved".

I don't believe any populists like Donald Trump, Nigel Ferage or Alice Weidel genuinely believe what they say. They are strategically manipulating the masses, getting them to love them by creating fake scenarios triggering strong emotional responses where, after very little thought, either side of the argument will have formed an immediate opinion about them as a leader.

# Conclusion

Populism is designed to divide the people.

Populism feeds on polarisation, therefore, nuance kills populism.

If I could suggest some take-aways for next time that you're browsing social media:

- Don't believe everything you read
- Check your emotional responses
- Check the integrity and motivation of those causing these responses
