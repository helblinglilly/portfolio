## Prefix

Is selfish to post an opinion about human values in reaction to news that directly targets a demographic which I'm part of? Maybe - but when people are willing to listen, say something that matters.

This is based on my personal opinions and experiences. Citation needed.

# Values

Remember when we were children, and we were thought to show kindness and compassion to each other? Every child's individuality is encouraged. We learn that it's okay to be different as, later in life, we will instincitvely fear the unknown.

> "Never be cruel and never be cowardly. And if you ever are, always make amends"<br />
<i>Peter Capaldi as the 12th Doctor, S9E12</i>

I like to remind myself of this every so often, because it's easy to become anger driven.

Compassion brings us together, it's how we bond with another. It unites us. A world without compassion is a world without community. It's a skill that is being suppressed, and later on I'll offer my opinion as to why that might be. We need to remind ourselves that we're all just people, and that we're at our best when we're supporting each other.

I struggle to describe the current political climate as anything other than cruel. Of course, depending on who you are, it's been this way for quite some time. Somehow, showing compassion and letting people live their lives has become political. While this is not a recent development, it has only started to affect me directly in recent years.

Progress is never linear and things will be better again - given time. Our task now is to make sure this will be sooner rather than later. In the meantime, let's not make things too difficult for ourselves, eh?

## Divide and conquer

This recent ruling is not _actually_ about "protecting" anybody. This is about making headlines, creating polarising debates and deplatforming those who disagree.

Queerphobes will be rubbing their hands together like flies, seeing the LGBTQ+ community infight, as to whether it includes the "T" or not. What groups like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGB_Alliance" target="_blank">LGB-Allience</a> fail to realise is that their part of the community will be next, until there is no acronym left and they are either in prisons or 6ft under.

Whether people are left handed, women, communists, gay, follow a different religion, or were born on the other side of an imaginary line on the ground, those in power will always seek to divide the people and create an "us and them". Creating a narritive that "we" need to be protected and that "they" are not welcome here. Where's the humanity in that? Where does this lead to? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_They_Came">History is full of examples</a>.

What would the working people, humanity, be able to achieve if we united? Power would be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens%27_assembly">distributed</a> and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-truth-social-djt-tesla-musk-tariffs-pause-fccfa6b06c8f1ec0cd7844641ca52669">less easily abused</a>.


In the immediate term, we can fight against this by calling out fabricated issues for what they are instead of engaging with them and normalising their discussion. In the long term, we need to stand up for each other, show empathy, and remember that we're all just people. It's never too late to learn, admit past mistakes, and try to be a better person tomorrow, than we were today.


## On the Supreme Courts decision

I am not going to entertain a dicussion about this. It is populism at its finest.

Gender is nuanced, complex, and individual - thereby not easily compatible with the law. As the objective was to clarify the law, creating a flow-chart with as few steps as possible, the result is sadly not surprising.

Much like software engineers, they were effectively asked to either take on a big project with a high maintenance burden, or reduce scope and create something that works 80% of the time and pretend the other 20% don't exist. Which of the examples below is easier to reason about?

<Code
languageName="ts"
code ={`interface Gender {
    // obviously this would be male-centric
    isMale: true | false
}`}
/>


or like this:

<Code
languageName="ts"
code ={`interface GenderIdentity {
    assignedGenderAtBirth: 'female' | 'male';
    anatomyAtBirth: 'venus' | 'mars'  | 'other';
    currentAnatomy: 'venus' | 'mars' | 'other';
    legalSex: 'female' | 'male'  | 'non-binary';
    perceivedIdentityBySociety: 'female' | 'male' | 'people_get_confused';
    identity: string;
    pronouns: Array<{
        direct: string;
        indirect: string;
    }>
}`}
/>


_If there are issues with the above, please get in touch - I don't mean to offend any groups but to illustrate a point._

The first example is of course simpler, and some might argue the second block is overly complicated and not applicable to everyday life. However, depending on the context, different parts of an identity might be relevant. A trans man being brought in for a prostate exam might not be appropriate. Identity will not matter when a person's remains are rediscovered in a couple of millenia. Some people might consider anatomy when dating, some might not.

In regards to the Equalities Act 2010, the relevant part of one's identity is what is perceived by society because as that's how people get discriminated against. It's a difficult task as ones perceived identity is subjective, but this was the task at hand.

The outcome, lining this up with a person's legal sex at birth, is not enforceable in everyday life, only in the courts. How could this possibly be protecting cis women in single-sex spaces? A predetor will not stop at the risk of a law suit or time in prison, same as they won't be stopped by a sign on a toilet door.<br />Who will be stopped by this? The trans woman who's just trying to go about her business. She will fear that it will take just on TERF to clock her, and her life could be turned upside down.

Trans men are, as per usual, completely forgotten about - despite the much graver security implications for women.

Following the logic which is now clarified in law, women are safe amongst men in single-sex spaces as long as they were born with the same genitalia. This does not work in everyday life as a <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=passing">passing</a> trans man using women-only spaces would raise far more suspicion than a passing
trans woman. Where are they supposed to do their business when they are legally not allowed in the men's single-sex spaces? It is also the nail in the coffin for the supposed safety argument. A predetor, who is somehow looking for an excuse, could just enter women's spaces and claim they're a trans man - no need to _put on a dress and makeup_ anymore.

No matter which perspective you consider, this ruling does not make practical sense. It is however, in the eyes of some people, the intuitive answer. It's the answer which aligns with their close-minded world view which dare not be challenged by anyone. I cannot offer a perfect, inclusive yet enforcable alternative. I am also not paid to do so.

# A tangent about democracy in the modern age

I'd like start with another quote from Peter Capaldi's era in Doctor Who.

> Doctor: "You could take this planet in a heartbeat. Why do you need consent?"<br />
  Monk: "We must be wanted. We must be loved. To rule through fear is inefficient"<br />
  <i>Doctor Who, S10E07</i>

In the next episode we learn that the monks, after taking over the world, have been rewriting history. Making it seem as though they have been helping humanity throughout history when in reality it has only been but months. The history books are written by the victors.

You might wonder how this applies, when there is no history to be written about yet. It's about controlling the narritive.

Observing discussions about any topic will make you question where you stand. You listen to both sides of the argument and consider which one you're more aligned with.
Now imagine - the conversation you're following is a collection of LLM (e.g. ChatGPT) powered Twitter bots talking to each other.

Which side did you pick? How did you emotionally respond to different arguments, and how did that shape your opinion of the other side? The impact this can have on us is significant yet often subconscious.

I think the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Internet_theory">dead internet theory</a> is more plausible than ever. Most people don't post online, they listen to what other people have to say.
I'd also argue that the way we hold discussions on the internet has become more polarising. Nobody is going to read through a long, researched, well articulated message and engage with it. Is it more entertaining to say "After considering all your points I agree with some, but not all" or "lol what, you are fundamentally wrong". Ragebait is more accessible, engages many more people and forms a clear, dividing line between two sides.

## We can be easily manipulated

Algorithms, controlled by a handful of people, decide what is worthy of people's attention and what is not. Meanwhile, LLMs are only becoming cheaper and more powerful to use at scale to give the impression of public sentiment. If you control both, you shape public opinion.

Strong emotional responses engage us, sometimes leading us to argue with strangers and bots. This didn't matter as much a couple of years ago. Platform cared about how much time actual humans spent on them so they could sell ads at a higher price. Twitter always struggled to break even, but it seems that they didn't care. They were in charge of a powerful platform and just wanted to keep it going, pulling the marionette strings in more or less subtle ways.

After Elon Musk took over, I believe he made public opinion his main goal but needed to raise more money to offset the loss in platform ad-worth this would create. People were always going to leave the platform in response to change, but this felt different. To me, it felt like the far-right echo chambers were just getting louder so I decided to leave.

## Engagement

Those that are still on X will be exposed more fake-arguments, ragebait, and radicalising discourse than before. Other major platforms are not any better, but X seems happy to do this in broad daylight. Engagement will only speed this up.

Every centralised platform will suffer from this - not one entity should be allowed to influence such a big cohort of people. We used to fear newspapers for this very reason, then helped build the digital empires of today.

I keep thinking about <a href="https://www.tomscott.com/">Tom Scott</a>'s video <a href="https://youtu.be/LkH2r-sNjQs">"Why Electronic Voting Is Still A Bad Idea"</a>. Specifically around the introduction. Trust cannot be placed in a single person as they could be bribed or incompetent and that attacks on digital voting systems scale easily. When this video was published the fear was that people seeking to get into power would rig the results. With today's technology, I'd argue, you don't need to rig an election result if you can easily sway people's opinion via social media.

"To rule through fear is inefficient. We must be loved".

I don't believe any populists like Donald Trump, Nigel Ferage or Alice Weidel genuinely believe what they say. They are strategically manipulating the masses, getting them to love them by creating fake scenarios triggering strong emotional responses where, after very little thought, either side of the argument will have formed an immediate opinion about them as a leader.

# Conclusion

Populism is designed to divide the people.

Populism feeds on polarisation, therefore, nuance kills populism.

If I could suggest some take-aways for next time that you're browsing social media:

- Don't believe everything you read
- Check your emotional responses
- Check the integrity and motivation of those causing these responses
