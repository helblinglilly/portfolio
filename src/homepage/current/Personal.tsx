      <h2 className="h2">What I do</h2>

      <p>For the past three years I've been in a cycle where I'm constantly rebuilding the same three projects, this website being one of them. The others are my <a href="https://github.com/helblinglilly/piserver" className="link">homelab</a> setup, and my pride and joy <a href="https://pokecompanion.com" className="link">Pok√©companion</a>.</p>

      <p>I basically just like to play around with stuff. Having the same few projects on hand means I can always try a new approach and go back if I don't like it.</p>

      <p>I've also become a bit more privacy focussed, and try to strike a balance between the control of self-hosting and redundancy mechanisms that VPS' can offer.</p>
